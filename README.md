## How To Compile
On Linux `cmake` and `libgtk4` are required to compile raylib and Gtk4 respectively please check your own OS instructions for each binding.

## How To Make A Design
Curently I only support SVGs with only the line tag being used see `/files` for examples. I recomend designing your SVGs in [LibreCad](https://librecad.org/) as that seems to be the easiest, especially if you plan on fabricated your designs for real life.
